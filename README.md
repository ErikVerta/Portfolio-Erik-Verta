# Kokchun Giang
I am a passionate engineer and teacher who strive to inspire students in pursuing the beauty of programming and mathematics. To do this successfully, I am always sharpening my technological and pedagogical skillsets. My pedagogical strategy is based on a combination of **structure** from special pedagogy and clear **visualization** from engineering. The main idea behind this is that clear structure and visualization are a neccessity for some, but beneficial for all.

 My journey started with studying [Engineering mathematics (BSc)][tekmat] followed by [Biomedical engineering (MSc)][biomed] at Chalmers University. After working in medtech industry with R&D, product development and regulatory affairs, I decided to go into the world of education.
